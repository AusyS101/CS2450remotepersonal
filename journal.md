Date: 9/22/2025 - Subject: Today we learned how to present and pitch our projects so investors / stakeholders will make a decision to invest on the project.

The better information that we can provide, the better the and more likely they will invest. Provide the best information as possible. 

Introduction -> Information About each Member -> In Scope for version 1.0 -> Out of scope version for 1.0 -> Soluiton Architecture -> UI mock up -> Summary and Conclusion -> Q&A.

Creating an impactful presentation:
    - This is complex, but well studied, There are a handful of things you can focus on right now that will make a BIG difference:
        - Who is the audience
        - What are the goals
        - Follow Design Principles

Design elements for slides.
    - LARGE THINGS ARE EMPHASIZED.
    - People's eyes travel from right and top to bottom in a diagonal way.
    - Bold and Italics help draw attention to key ideas.

    -Color is really important. It conveys all kinds of information.

    - Size and number of elements on a page draw your eye. You can change emphasis on components by making them largr or smaller.

    - Information density is a critical consideration. 

    -Pictures are necessary.

Color Can:
    - Communicate Emotion and Evoke Feelings.
    - Highlight specific elements
    - Indicate Emphasis.
    - Convey information (another dimension for example.)
    - Creates visual interest.

Some Color Guidelines to follow:
    - Red is some kind of alert, problem or critical element.
    - Yellow is for highlighting chages or new things.
    - Green is for good things or familiar things.
    - Gray is for out of scope or not conequence.
    - Blue for neutral or existing things.
    - Orange for pay attention for Things THAT ARE CHANGING.
    This -> That

Consistency:
    - Be consistent with arrows. Always use arros to show initiation of action.
    - Be consitent with your shapes. You can use different shapes to represent different kindsof things, but be sure the reason for the different shapes is obvious and clear.
    - Bi-directional arrows usually mean bi-directional communication- info that is useless in most cases.
    - Use number bubbles to keep from cluttering your diagram with explanations of relationships.

Date: 9/26/2025 - Subject: Today we learned about System Design. We discussed how the best engineers will be the ones who know how to think through the problems in code, not the ones who can code the fastest. 

Content Delivery Networks: Client (computer) -> make attp request -> servers produce a support file -> recieved by client.

Date: 9/29/2025 - Subject: Component Diagrams are a really impportant tool, that should be used throughout a career in software. We should go back over this.
